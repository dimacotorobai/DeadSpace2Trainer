This is a trainer for the game Dead Space 2. This trainer was created in python with the use of the ctypes and pywin32 libraries. This trainer contains Godmode, Infinite Ammo, Infinite Stasis, Infite Air, as well as constant read and write for Nodes and Credits. This is an external hack and as such it uses code caves instead of function hooking. Future updates will include One Shot Kill and Rapid Fire.
